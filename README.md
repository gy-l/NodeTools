# The node tools

## excel2json

This tool is only temporary on-demand,
edit excel2json.js file and use `run code`
or Execute command
```
node excel2json.js

```
to creat json what you need,

the demand is always changing and less scenarios to use, 
so do not spend too much time necessary to customize for various scenarios

## compare

This tool is for two json to cmpare and filter duplicate in two,
edit compare.js file and use `run code`
or Execute command

## file2fold
This tool is for Temporary urgent needs of business units,
There are batches of video files that need to be put into separate folders named after these files.
This will take them a lot of time and is error-prone,
So I spent half an hour writing this tool,Batch processed.
edit file2fold.js file and use `run code`
or Execute command
```
node file2fold.js

```
to make it working
